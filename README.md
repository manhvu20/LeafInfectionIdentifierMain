# LeafInfectionIdentifierMain
This is my Python project when I studied Image Processing

In this project, we can upload an image of a leaf and research if the leaf is diseased or not and which diseased is the leaf have.

Because of the time, I can only train data of 4 kind of leaves: healthy, multiple diseases, rust and scab. The data can be trained more with many kind of leaves and can be developed with some function such as: suggesting the cure for diseased leaf, suggesting which plant should we grow for season, etc
